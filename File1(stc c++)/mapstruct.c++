// map  structure 
/*
A map is a generalized array that consists of key-value-pairs. While the keys in
an ordinary array are always the consecutive integers 0, 1, . . . , n âˆ’ 1, where n is
the size of the array, the keys in a map can be of any data type and they do not
have to be consecutive values.
The C++ standard library contains two map implementations that correspond
to the set implementations: the structure map is based on a balanced binary tree
and accessing elements takes O (log n ) time, while the structure unordered_map
uses hashing and accessing elements takes O (1) time on average.
